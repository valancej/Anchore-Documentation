## Anchore Support

Anchore Enterprise customers should have a primary point of contact at Anchore with whom they can raise immediate issues. In addition, our customers can file tickets via Anchore's Freshdesk site located here: https://anchore.freshdesk.com/support/home

All Anchore users are welcome to join our community Slack channel located here: https://anchore.com/slack

## Getting started

This document will detail the necessary requirements for installing Anchore Enteprise with Docker Compose. 

### Hardware requirements

The following details the minimum hardware requirements needed to run a single instance of all containers:

- 2 CPUs
- 8 GB RAM
- 50 GB disk space

**Note:** Increased CPUs and RAM is recommended for better performance.

### Kubernetes requirements

- A running Kubernetes Cluster is required.
- kubectl configured to access your Kubernetes cluster.

*Read more on Kubernetes here:* https://kubernetes.io/  
*Read more on kubectl configuration here:* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/

### Helm requirements

- The Helm binary should be installed and available on your path.
- Tiller, the server side component for Helm, should be installed and available inside your Kubernetes cluster.

*Read more on Helm here:* https://helm.sh/

### Operating System requirements

- Ubuntu 16.04x or higher
- CentOS 7.3 or higher
- RHEL 7.3 or higher
- Amazon Linux 2

### Software requirements

The Anchore Enterprise UI is a web application with an HTML interface. Accessing the user interface is done via a web browser.

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari

### Network requirements

Anchore Enterprise Feeds exposes a RESTful API by default on port 8228, however this port can be remapped. 

Anchore Enterprise Feeds require access to the upstream data feeds from the following supported distributions and package registries over port 443:

| Host | Port | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :----------- |
| linux.oracle.com | 443 | Oracle Linux Security Feed |
| github.com | 443 | Alpine Linux Security Database |
| redhat.com | 443 | Red Hat Enterprise Linux Security Database |
| security-tracker.debain.org | 443 | Debian Security Feed |
| salsa.debian.org | 443 | Debian Security Feed |
| replicate.npmjs.com | 443 | NPM Registry Package Data |
| s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com | 443 | Ruby Gems Data Feed |
| static.nvd.nist.gov | 443 | NVD Database |
| launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker | 443 | Ubuntu Data |
| data.anchore-enterprise.com | 443 | Snyk data |

**Note:** Air-gapped installs will differ.

Anchore Enterprise UI by default will be accessible over http://localhost:3000.

### Database requirements

Anchore Enterprise uses PostgreSQL object-relational database to store data. Before beginning install, determine whether you will be using the managed PostgreSQL service container that is automatically installed with this chart or an external PostgreSQL instance. 

**Note:** It is recommended to use an external PostgreSQL instance for production grade deployments. See configuring external DB instance for more info.


### PostgreSQL versions

The PostgreSQL container that is automatically installed with Anchore Enterprise is postgres:9. 

Anchore Enterprise supports PostgeSQL version 9.6 or higher

## Installation

- Approved Dockerhub username is required to pull Anchore Enterprise images.
- A valid Anchore Enterprise license.yaml file.

### About this Helm Chart

This chart will can deploy both the Anchore Engine (OSS) and Anchore Enterprise systems. The chart is split into global and service specific configurations for the OSS Anchore Engine, as well as the global and service specific configurations for the Enterprise components. The recommended way to install Anchore Enterprise via this chart is to create a new file names `anchore_values.yaml` and add the desired fields. 

- The `anchoreGlobal` section is for the configuration values required by all Anchore Engine components.
- The `anchoreEnterpriseGlobal` section is for configuration values required by all Anchore Enginer Enterprise components. 
- Service specific configuration values allow customization for each individual service.

In addition to the database the chart creates two deployments: 

- Core services: The core services deployment includes the external api, notification service, kubenetes webhook, catalog and queuing service. 
- Worker: The worker service conducts the image analysis and can be scaled out to handle concurrent evaluation of images.

In this example we will deploy the database, core services, a single worker, and the enterprise components.

Enterprise components include:

- Role based access control (RBAC)
- On-prem feeds service
- Snyk vulnerability data
- Graphical User Interface

### Step 1: Create kubernetes secret containing the enterprise license.yaml file

*Run kubectl command below to generate a secret for the license file: *

`kubectl create secret generic anchore-enterprise-license --from-file=license.yaml=<PATH/TO/LICENSE.YAML>`

### Step 2: Create kubernetes secret containing valid dockerhub credentials with access to private Anchore Enterprise repositories

*Run kubectl command below to generate a secret for dockerhub credentials:*

`kubectl create secret docker-registry anchore-enterprise-pullcreds --docker-server=docker.io --docker-username=<DOCKERHUB_USER> --docker-password=<DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD> --docker-email=<EMAIL_ADDRESS>`

### Step 3: Install Helm Chart using custom anchore_values.yaml file

**Note:** By default, all services (including a bundled DB instance) will be transient, and data will be lost if you shut down/restart.

**Note:** This chart will install a managed PostgreSQL database and Redis.

Create `anchore_values.yaml` file and enter the following:

```
## anchore_values.yaml

anchoreEnterpriseGlobal:
  enabled: True
```

Set `anchoreEnterpriseGlobal` to true in order to enable the enterprise components.

*Install the Helm Chart by running the following command (remember to pass in the custom values file):*

`helm install --name <release_name> -f /path/to/anchore_values.yaml stable/anchore-engine`

### Step 4: Verify services are up 

If the previous command was run successfully, you should see Anchore notes in the terminal describing how to access the Anchore Engine services. 

*Run the following command to see the pods:* 

`kubectl get pods`

The output should look like the example below: 

```
anchore-demo-anchore-engine-analyzer-5c87776cbc-4drvr           1/1       Running   0          47m
anchore-demo-anchore-engine-api-7868d8bc68-xjsqg                3/3       Running   0          47m

anchore-demo-anchore-feeds-db-64f895cd75-8fshd                  1/1       Running   0          47m
anchore-demo-anchore-ui-redis-master-0                          1/1       Running   0          47m
anchore-demo-postgresql-54f5d746d5-drzrd                        1/1       Running   0          47m
```

*In order to check on the status of the Anchore services, run the following command:*

`kubectl run -i --tty anchore-cli --restart=Always --image anchore/engine-cli --env ANCHORE_CLI_USER=admin --env ANCHORE_CLI_PASS=${ANCHORE_CLI_PASS} --env ANCHORE_CLI_URL=http://<anchore_service_endpoint>:8228/v1/`

From within the container, you are able to use 'anchore-cli' commands:

Ex. `anchore-cli system status`

The ouput should look like the example below:

```
Service analyzer (anchore-demo-anchore-engine-analyzer-5c87776cbc-4drvr, http://anchore-demo-anchore-engine-analyzer:8084): up
Service simplequeue (anchore-demo-anchore-engine-simplequeue-784597f666-qssrm, http://anchore-demo-anchore-engine-simplequeue:8083): up
Service rbac_authorizer (anchore-demo-anchore-engine-api-7868d8bc68-xjsqg, http://localhost:8089): up
Service apiext (anchore-demo-anchore-engine-api-7868d8bc68-xjsqg, http://anchore-demo-anchore-engine-api:8228): up
Service rbac_manager (anchore-demo-anchore-engine-api-7868d8bc68-xjsqg, http://anchore-demo-anchore-engine-api:8229): up
Service policy_engine (anchore-demo-anchore-engine-policy-74c4956dc7-l66gw, http://anchore-demo-anchore-engine-policy:8087): up
Service catalog (anchore-demo-anchore-engine-catalog-546bfbc499-jbwls, http://anchore-demo-anchore-engine-catalog:8082): up

Engine DB Version: 0.0.8
Engine Code Version: 0.3.1
```

Important to note that upon initial install of Anchore Enterprise, it will take some time for vulnerability data to be synced into Anchore. For the most optimal experience, wait until all vulnerability data feeds have synced before performing any image analysis operations. 

*Run the following command to wait for until Anchore is available and ready*

`anchore-cli system wait`

You should see output like the example below when Anchore is ready:

```
Starting checks to wait for anchore-engine to be available timeout=-1.0 interval=5.0
API availability: Checking anchore-engine URL (http://0.0.0.0:8228/v1)...
API availability: Success.
Service availability: Checking for service set (catalog,simplequeue,analyzer,policy_engine,apiext)...
Service availability: Success.
Feed sync: Checking sync completion for feed set (vulnerabilities)...
Feed sync: Success.
```

### Checking the status of the Enterprise Data Feeds

*You can check on the status of the data feeds by running the following command:*

`anchore-cli system feeds list`

The ouput should look like the example below:

```
Feed                   Group                  LastSync                          RecordCount

```

At this point, Anchore Enteprise should now be fully installed and you can begin to analyze images.

## Installing Anchore-CLI

The Anchore CLI provides a command line interface on top of the Anchore Engine REST API.

Anchore CLI github repo: https://github.com/anchore/anchore-cli
Anchore CLI Dockerhub repo: https://hub.docker.com/r/anchore/engine-cli/

### Running the Anchore CLI Container

This image provides a simple way to interact with a Anchore Engine service installation.

*To use the container run the following command:*

`kubectl run -i --tty anchore-cli --restart=Always --image anchore/engine-cli --env ANCHORE_CLI_USER=admin --env ANCHORE_CLI_PASS=${ANCHORE_CLI_PASS} --env ANCHORE_CLI_URL=http://<anchore_service_endpoint>:8228/v1/`

From this container's shell you can use 'anchore-cli' commands. Ex. `anchore-cli system status`

**Note:** See below for commmand for analyzing your first image.

### Install Anchore CLI from source

The Anchore CLI can be installed from source using the Python pip utility.

```
git clone https://github.com/anchore/anchore-cli
cd anchore-cli
pip install --user --upgrade .
```

### Configuring the Anchore CLI

By default the Anchore CLI will try to connect to the Anchore Engine at http://localhost/v1 with no authentication. The username, password and URL for the server can be passed to the Anchore CLI as command line arguments.

```
--u   TEXT   Username     eg. admin
--p   TEXT   Password     eg. foobar
--url TEXT   Service URL  eg. http://localhost:8228/v1
```

Rather than passing these parameters for every call to the cli they can be stores as environment variables.

```
ANCHORE_CLI_URL=http://myserver.example.com:8228/v1
ANCHORE_CLI_USER=admin
ANCHORE_CLI_PASS=foobar
```

### Scanning your first image

Now that both Anchore Enterprise and the Anchore CLI have been install and configured, you can begin to scan images.

*Run the following command to scan your first image:*

`anchore-cli image add docker.io/library/alpine:latest`


## Configuring an external PostgreSQL instance

As stated in the database requirements above, Anchore requires access to a PostgreSQL database. The database can be run as a container out of the box with a persisted volume or outside of your container environment. If you choose to use an external PostgreSQL Database, the connection string should be specified in the config.yaml file. 

**Note:** The default configuration points to the host anchore-db on port 5432 using username postgres and password mysecretpassword.

If you are configuring an external database service (e.g. Amazon RDS), updated the host, port, username, password, and database name.

Here is the database section of the config.yaml file with environment variables being passed in: 

*Database section of config.yaml file*

```
credentials:
  database:
    db_connect: 'postgresql+pg8000://${ANCHORE_DB_USER}:${ANCHORE_DB_PASSWORD}@${ANCHORE_DB_HOST}:${ANCHORE_DB_PORT}/${ANCHORE_DB_NAME}'
    db_connect_args:
      timeout: 120
      ssl: false
    db_pool_size: 30
    db_pool_max_overflow: 100
```

Within the docker-compose.yaml file you can specify the database environment variables to be passed into the config.yaml file like so: 

*API service section of docker-compose.yaml file*

```
services:
  # The primary API endpoint service
  engine-api:
    image: anchore/anchore-engine:v0.3.1
    depends_on:
    - engine-catalog
    volumes:
    - ./config-engine.yaml:/config/config.yaml:z
    ports:
    - "8228:8228"
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: 100m
    environment:
    - ANCHORE_ENDPOINT_HOSTNAME=engine-api
    - ANCHORE_DB_HOST=anchore-db-instance.<123456>.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com
    - ANCHORE_DB_NAME=anchore_db
    - ANCHORE_DB_USER=dbusername
    - ANCHORE_DB_PASSWORD=dbpassword
    - ANCHORE_DB_PORT=dbport
    - ANCHORE_AUTHZ_HANDLER=external
    - ANCHORE_EXTERNAL_AUTHZ_ENDPOINT=http://enterprise-rbac-authorizer:8228
    - ANCHORE_ENABLE_METRICS=false
    command: ["anchore-manager", "service", "start",  "apiext"]
```

Anchore should now be able to connect to your external PostgreSQL DB instance. 

## Accessing logs

There may be cases where you need to inspect the logs for Anchore services. 

### Viewing logs for pod containers

*Use the docker logs command to view the logs for an individual pod container:*

`kubectl logs <my-pod-name>`

### Viewing logs for specific Anchore services

You can execute into a specific pod to view logs for an Anchore service.

*Use the docker exec command to enter a pod container:*

`kubectl exec -it <my-pod-name> /bin/bash`

The logs are located in the `/var/log/anchore` directory within the container.
